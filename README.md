#### By _**Kaveh Saleminejad**_

## Description

_it gets a word and a sentence from user. Then it will count how many times the inputed word appears in the sentence. It just check for full word matches only, and if part of a word in sentence matches with the inputed word it just will ignore it._

## Behavior-Driven Development

* _First make sure the input word and sentence are valid_
_For example: "" is not valid for both and "Hey you" is not valid for word_
* _Next change both the input word and sentence to lowercase characters_
_For example: "I am happy" should be change to  ["i am happy"]_
* _Then chunk the sentence into an array of words and get rid of all characters except alphabets and numbers_
_For example: "i am happy." should be create ["i","am","happy"]_
* _After that check the input word with all words in the sentence to find the duplicates_
_For example: the word "found" appears once in the ["i", "found", "a", "solution"]_
